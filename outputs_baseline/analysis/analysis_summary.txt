OpenStack Log Analysis Summary
==================================================

Dataset Overview:
- Total log entries: 2000
- Time range: 2017-05-16 00:00:00.008000 to 2017-05-16 00:14:47.687000
- Duration: 0 days 00:14:47.679000

Anomaly Detection:
- Normal events: 1907 (95.3%)
- Anomalous events: 93 (4.7%)

Memory Analysis:
- Memory spikes detected: 9
- API requests analyzed: 1017
- Slow requests: 12
- Error requests: 41
- VM lifecycle events: 109
- Lifecycle anomalies: 1

Recommendations for Model Training:
- Use 5-minute sliding windows for sequence creation
- Focus on memory usage, API latency, and lifecycle patterns
- Apply class weighting due to imbalanced dataset
- Consider data augmentation for minority class (anomalies)
